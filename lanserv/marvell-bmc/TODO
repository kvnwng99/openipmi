  * I really need to find a way to set the time and date on the system. 
    Is there some hardware clock on this system?  I didn't find one on
    schematics, but perhaps it is buried in some chip someplace. 
    Otherwise, we need to define a way to get the time from outside the
    system using NTP.
  * I need to write documentation for the full system.  I have a few
    more hours left than I thought, so I should be able to do a pretty
    good job of this.
  * I need to define the procedures for building the entire system.  Include
    busybox mods for arp to work.
  * I need to find the memory usage for ipmi_sim.
  * Automatically clear the IERR and DIMM errors from the board.
  * Save SOL history data on receiving a shutdown signal.
  * Power/reset all boards on a chassis operation.

Done:
  * I need to do some more testing on board, fan and power supply
    removal, to make sure that the sensors all change states properly
    and the fans behave properly under different circumstances.  I've
    done some testing by dummy-ing things out, but I need to drive over
    to the lab and test it for real.
  * Check that board power cannot be enabled if board is not present.
  * Fix syslog
  * I need to integrate the Marvell-specific code into a subdirectory of
    lanserv so it can be built along with the standard OpenIPMI code. 
  * Fan fail LEDS.
  * This all needs to go up to the public OpenIPMI repository.
